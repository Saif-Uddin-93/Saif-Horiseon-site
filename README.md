# Saif-Horiseon-site

## Description
The purpose of this project is to refactor the Horiseon webpage, a placeholder marketing site, to increase code efficiency and readability. This has been accomplished by implementing semantic HTML, consolidating HTML classes with the same CSS styling, and adding comments to highlight modifications with brief explanations.

Visually and functionally, the end result remains identical to the original version of the webpage, with all changes confined to the HTML and CSS. The primary advantage of these adjustments is to enable other web developers to immediately be able to identify what sections of code affects the different sections of the webpage by looking at the semantic HTML tags, also determining which elements require matching CSS styles by the re-used classes.

## Installation
For this project, the developer tool I'll be using is VS Code. A lightweight IDE that allows working in HTML and CSS. It also allows the use of Extensions which can add extra functionality to the tool to help with debugging and making code more readable. The main extension I'll be using is called, Live Server, by Ritwick Dey. The browser that the web page will be used on is Google Chrome and will work on all Chromium based web browsers.

## Usage
Below is a screenshot of parts of the edited HTML and CSS showing comments and removed code:
